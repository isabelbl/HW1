      <p>As you may have already figured out, my name is Isabel Blanco,
        I currently live in Fontana, California. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Cognitive 
        Science with an emphasis in neuroscience. Currently, I am in the works of
        becoming a full-stack web developer from the University of California,
        Riverside. I plan to dive into the field as soon as I finish to gain 
        real-world experience. My goal is to find a career that combines medical science with computer
        science.
        Now if you made it this far, bare with me, because I don't know what else to write at this 
        moment. I am trying to make this paragraph longer for design purposes. I want to see if my 
        text is able to wrap around my image. Thank you for your patience.</p>
